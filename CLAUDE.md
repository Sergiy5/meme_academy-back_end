# Meme Academy - Project Context

## Overview
A multiplayer meme party game built with Next.js (client) and Socket.io (server). Players join rooms, get dealt meme cards, and compete to match memes to funny phrases. The judge picks the funniest combination each round.

## Tech Stack
- **Client**: Next.js 14+ (App Router), TypeScript, Tailwind CSS v4, Zustand (state)
- **Server**: Node.js, Express, Socket.io (separate repository)
- **Styling**: Custom neon green game theme in `src/app/styles/game.css`

## Game Flow & Phases

```
lobby → phrase_selection → picking → judging → result → phrase_selection → ...
```

| Phase | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `lobby` | Players join, host can start when 3+ players |
| `phrase_selection` | Judge picks from 3 phrase options (3-slide carousel: center card + 7% peek on sides) |
| `picking` | Non-judge players select a meme from their hand |
| `judging` | Judge sees all submitted memes, picks winner |
| `result` | Shows winner, scoreboard. **Winner** clicks "Next Round" |

**Important**: Winner becomes the next judge and sees the phrase selection screen.

## Socket Events

### Client → Server
| Event | Payload | Description |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| `create_room` | `{ nickname }` | Create new room |
| `join_room` | `{ roomCode, nickname }` | Join existing room |
| `reconnect_room` | `{ playerId, roomCode }` | Reconnect after disconnect |
| `start_game` | - | Host starts game |
| `select_phrase` | `{ phraseId }` | Judge selects phrase for round |
| `submit_meme` | `{ memeId }` | Player submits meme |
| `select_winner` | `{ oderId }` | Judge picks winning meme |
| `next_round` | - | Winner triggers next round |

### Server → Client
| Event | Payload | Description |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| `room_created` | `{ roomCode, playerId }` | Room creation success |
| `room_joined` | `{ playerId }` | Join success |
| `room_state` | `{ state: GameState }` | Full game state sync |
| `hand_dealt` | `{ hand: MemeCard[] }` | Player's meme cards |
| `player_joined` | `{ player }` | New player joined |
| `player_left` | `{ playerId }` | Player disconnected |
| `player_reconnected` | `{ playerId }` | Player reconnected |
| `phrase_selected` | `{ phrase }` | Judge selected phrase |
| `player_submitted` | `{ playerId }` | A player submitted meme |
| `winner_selected` | `{ winnerId, oderId }` | Judge picked winner |
| `new_round` | `{ round }` | New round started |
| `error` | `{ message }` | Error message |

## Key Types

```typescript
type GamePhase = 'lobby' | 'phrase_selection' | 'picking' | 'judging' | 'result';

interface Player {
  id: PlayerId;
  nickname: string;
  avatarColor: string;
  score: number;
  isConnected: boolean;
  isHost: boolean;
}

interface RoundState {
  roundNumber: number;
  judgeId: PlayerId;
  phraseOptions: Phrase[];      // 3 options for judge to choose
  phrase: Phrase | null;        // Selected phrase (null during phrase_selection)
  submittedPlayerIds: PlayerId[];
  revealedSubmissions: Submission[];
  winnerId: PlayerId | null;
  winningMemeId: string | null;
}

interface GameState {
  roomCode: RoomCode;
  phase: GamePhase;
  players: Player[];
  hostId: PlayerId;
  currentRound: RoundState | null;
}
```

## Server Architecture

Server code is in a **separate repository**. See `SERVER_CONTEXT.md` for full server documentation.

Key server responsibilities:
- Room management (create, join, reconnect, disconnect)
- Game state management and phase transitions
- Validation (is judge? is winner? correct phase?)
- Hand dealing and replenishment

## Styling Notes

- Uses Tailwind v4 with `@theme` in `theme.css` for custom colors
- Game theme colors: `--color-game-*` (neon green: `#39FF14`)
- Use `text-game-text-dim` for muted text (`#9ca3af`)
- Button classes: `game-btn game-btn-primary`, `game-btn-secondary`, `game-btn-ghost`
- Card classes: `game-card`, `phrase-card`, `meme-card`

## Environment Variables

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SOCKET_URL=http://localhost:3001  # Server URL
PORT=3001                                      # Server port
```

## Important Patterns

1. **State sync**: Server always emits `room_state` after state changes
2. **Phase transitions**: Server controls all phase changes
3. **Validation**: Server validates all actions (is judge? is winner? correct phase?)
4. **Reconnection**: Players can reconnect via sessionStorage `playerId` + `roomCode`
5. **Selectors**: Use Zustand selectors (`selectIsJudge`, `selectIsWinner`, etc.) for derived state
